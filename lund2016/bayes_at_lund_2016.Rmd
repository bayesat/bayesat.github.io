Researchers and students are welcome to participate in the third edition of Bayes&#64;Lund! The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers working with or interested in Bayesian methods. Bayes&#64;Lund aims at being **accesible** to researchers with little experience of Bayesian methods while still being **relevant** to experienced practitioners. The focus is on how Bayesian methods are used in research, what advantages Bayesian methods have over classical alternatives, and how the use and teaching of Bayesian methods can be encouraged. 

<img src="EJ_smaller.jpeg" alt="EJ" align="right" style="margin: 10px">

The conference will include a number of short contributed talks, an invited presentation by [Robert Grant](http://www.robertgrantstats.co.uk/) and a Keynote presentation by [Eric-Jan Wagenmakers](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/). The day before the conference Eric-Jan Wagenmakers will also hold a tutorial seminar on Bayesian inference. More information about this event [here](#pre-conference-tutorial-on-bayesian-inference).

#### Keynote speaker: Eric-Jan Wagenmakers

This year we are happy to announce that the keynote speaker is Eric-Jan Wagenmakers,  professor in the Psychological Methods unit at the University of Amsterdam. He is a passionate advocate of Bayesian statistics and has published the textbook [*Bayesian Cognitive Modeling: A Practical Course*](http://bayesmodels.com/) and [numerous papers](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L_HG640AAAAJ&hl=en) on the subject. He is currently the supervisor of [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/), an open source program with the aim of making Bayesian statistics accessible to the masses. His keynote presentation is titled ***Bayesian Benefits for the Pragmatic Researcher*** touching upon the concrete ways in which Bayesian inference can improve the scientific process.


Call for Presentations
------------------------

To contribute a presentation for Bayes&#64;Lund please send in the title of your talk with an abstract (not more than 100 words) to rasmus.baath@lucs.lu.se. Final date for presentations submission is the 20th of December. Any topic related to Bayesian methods is relevant including, but not restricted to:

* **Case studies**. Have you used Bayesian methods in your research? Describe what you did, and how it worked out.
* **Tutorial style talks**. Want to share your favourite tool or modeling technique? This does not have to be novel research, just a useful tool *for* research!
* **Method development**. Are you developing novel Bayesian methods that you want to share?
* **Teaching Bayes**. Do you have experiences teaching Bayesian methods. What was the challenges, and do you have any useful tips?

Each accepted speaker is given 20 minutes and, as the audience will be highly heterogeneous, the talk is expected to be accessible and engaging for a multidisciplinary audience.

Pre-conference tutorial on Bayesian inference
-------------------------

The day before the conference there will be a tutorial seminar on Bayesian inference by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers, a great opportunity to learn or brush up the basics of Bayes! 

**Date?** Thursday 4th of February, 2016.

**Time?** 13:30 - 16:00, including break.

**Where?** Room B152 in the Lux building, Lund University. How to find it: http://www.ht.lu.se/en/lux/kontakt/kartor-och-fardsatt/

**What?** In the first part of the seminar, the principles of Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesis testing will be illustrated with a concrete example. The second part of the seminar features a brief tour of [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/), a software program that showcases the practical feasibility of the Bayesian agenda.

**How?** To sign up for the tutorial please use [the Conference registration form above](#conference-registration). Note that the number of spaces available on the tutorial is limited.
