The prior is a key concept in Bayesian statistics that distinguishes it
 from most other statistical methods.
 Historically, it has caused many resentments against Bayesian statistics
 in general and remains a controversial topic to date.
 In my talk, I want to explain why we should usually not be too afraid of
 priors.
 At the same time, I want to highlight situations where thinking about priors
 is mandatory and incredibly helpful for reliable inference.

Evaluation of microbiological and chemical food safety risks typically involves
 several linked models.
 These describe different causal processes contributing to the consumer
 risk and can employ several data sets.
 When combining evidence, Bayesian modeling is a valuable and flexible method
 that can be used to assess, e.g., process control options and dietary exposure.

This talk discusses the use of Bayesian priors for modeling the spatial
 distribution of brain activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging
 (fMRI).
 The data are naturally 4D, consisting of 3D brain images measured over
 time, each having hundreds of thousands of data points.
 The Bayesian approach is attractive because (1) it gives posterior probabilitie
s of activation in different brain regions; (2) the amount of spatial dependence
 can be inferred from the data and (3) the large scale computational problem
 can be efficiently handled using sparse Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF)
 priors.

This talk with introduce the the brms package which implements Bayesian
 multilevel models in R using the probabilistic programming language Stan.
 A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing
 users to fit linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, response
 times, ordinal, quantile, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear models
 all in a multilevel context.
 In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted
 in order to perform distributional regression.
 Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply
 prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.
 In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior
 predictive checks and leave-one-out cross-validation.

While the advantages of a Bayesian approach are increasingly acknowledged,
 many are discouraged by the steep learning curve and the large amount of
 manual coding.
 In this talk I demonstrate how mixed models, a staple of modern data analysis,
 can be easily fit and explored with just a few lines of code using brms
 package.
 Starting with a dataset from a real experiment, in which listeners judged
 the authenticity of emotional vocalizations (a binary outcome), I will
 go through model specification, diagnostics, plotting, and reporting the
 results.

It is difficult to suppress the urge to look at your smartphone if there
 is a sudden flash on the screen.
 But would you still look at the phone if the flash always signals wrong
 information? We addressed this question using a visual temporal order judgment
 task, in which participants had to judge which of two stimuli appeared
 first.
 Some trials were preceded by a counterproductive exogenous cue, i.e., always
 signaling where the second target would appear.
 Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison (using the brms package
 in R) revealed that the cue, despite being counterproductive, consistently
 attracted attention.

A recurring challenge in behavioral studies of animal senses is the analysis
 of angular data, which frequently occurs from tracking orientation or direction
 of movement.
 Analysis and visualization of these data are fraught with challenges, as
 they can be easy to misinterpret.
 Within the fields of animal sensory ecology and navigation, angular data
 has typically been investigated by comparing treatments using a limited
 set of significance tests.
 These approaches are inflexible and neglect pooling and measures of effect
 size and uncertainty.
 To address this, I have sought to analyse angular behavioral data using
 models in the Stan language.

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are commonly used in many research
 fields, including ecology and evolution.
 GLMMs and the software for analyzing them offer great flexibility in for
 instance the number of variables and error structure, but obviously assume
 linearity.
 The tremendous flexibility of Stan to customize the structure of models
 offers a great, but underused potential for investigating more complex
 correlational/causality patterns.
 Here I will showcase 3 studies on humans, birds and waterfleas, in which
 I have used Stan to customize model structures to answer questions in ecology
 and evolution for which GLMMs have limited potential.

In psychology, Bayes Factors (BFs) are being increasingly reported as a
 complement to p-values.
 However, just as the mindless computation of p-values encourages a simple
 dichotomization of study results, the mindless computation of BFs with
 an overemphasis on hypothesis testing detracts from more useful approaches
 to interpreting study results, such as parameter estimation.
 BFs may serve to facilitate the transition from frequentist to Bayesian
 data analysis, but let us not repeat mistakes of the past.
 In this short talk, I shall argue that Bayesian parameter estimation is
 preferred with an example from a recent Master thesis.

Sequential testing refers to the process of collecting data until a predefined
 level of evidence is reached.
 Recently, Schönbrodt, Wagenmakers, Zehetleitner, & Perugini (2017) and
 Schönbrodt & Wagenmakers (2017) have introduced the Sequential Bayes Factors
 (SBF) procedure, in order to avoid the pitfalls associated with sequential
 testing in the NHST framework.
 The R package ESTER (Nalborczyk, 2017) proposes an alternative approach
 that uses evidence ratios based on either Akaike weights computed from
 AIC (e.g., Burnham & Anderson, 2004) or pseudo-BMA weights computed from
 the WAIC or the LOO-CV of Bayesian models (Yao, Simpson, & Gelman, 2017).

So you have postulated a nice model and now you want to perform Bayesian
 inference for the model parameters.
 Great.
 The problem is the model has a non-standard likelihood function..
 In other words your model is sufficiently complex that you can't write
 the likelihood function and therefore cannot perform full-fledged Bayesian
 analysis.
 This situation is actually the norm when working with realistic models.
 However there are strategies to deal with so-called "intractable likelihoods"
 using "likelihood-free inference".
 The most important examples of these methods are "approximate Bayesian
 computation" (ABC) and "synthetic likelihoods".
 I will give an introduction to both methods.

Bayesian inference is based on evaluation of posterior distribution via
 likelihood function.
 However even for the simplest models sometimes there is no way for defining
 likelihood function in analytical way.
 In such situations, we still can perform Bayesian reasoning via Approximate
 Bayesian Computation techniques.
 In my talk, I want to provide an overview on typical ways to perform ABC
 and corresponding software packages.
 To demonstrate flexibility of this method I would like to present my use
 case on performing ABC on very complex simulator based model with 1 data
 point while still achieving useful results.

Bayesian statistics is a rich a deep topic, but you have to start somewhere.
 And there are many places to start, and many ways educators introduce Bayesian
 statistics: From probability as personal belief to just focussing on Markov
 chain Monte Carlo.
 In this short talk I'll give a demonstration of what I think is one good
 way of introducing Bayes to beginners.
