Stan has rapidly become one of the most popular packages for Bayesian modeling
 in recent years.
 It is open-source and free, and uses a newer, faster and more stable algorithm
 than the method in BUGS, JAGS, MLwiN, Stata and SAS.
 I will introduce the software and highlight where it will have particular
 advantages for researchers.
 An application will be given in detail from a recent meta-analysis of the
 psycho-social benefits of exercise interventions for people with osteoarthritis.
 The published evidence measures benefit with different scales, dichotomises
 them in different ways, and reports different summary statistics, all of
 which are potentially problematic for analysis.

The practical advantages of Bayesian inference are demonstrated through
 two concrete examples.
 In the first example, we wish to learn whether or not a criminal is intellectua
lly disabled --- this is a problem of parameter estimation.
 In the second example, we wish to quantify support in favor of a null hypothesi
s, and track this support as the data accumulate --- this is a problem of
 hypothesis testing.
 The Bayesian framework unifies both problems within a coherent predictive
 framework, where parameters and models that predicted the data successfully
 will receive a boost in plausibility, whereas parameters and models that
 predicted poorly suffer a decline.
 Our examples demonstrate how Bayesian analyses can be more informative,
 more elegant, and more flexible than the orthodox methodology that remains
 dominant within many fields.

The reading difficulty associated with Chinese relative clauses presents
 an important empirical problem for psycholinguistic research on sentence
 comprehension processes, but the results vary from study to study.
 We carried out a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis using 15 published
 studies; this analysis showed that the posterior probability of a subject
 relative advantage is approximately 0.77.
 Bias modelling was used to incorporate expert opinion quantitatively in
 the model.
 As a proof of concept, we identified biases in five of the fifteen studies,
 and elicited priors on these using the SHELF framework.
 Then we fitted a random-effects meta-analysis, including priors on biases.
 This analysis showed a stronger posterior probability (0.96) of a subject
 relative advantage compared to the standard random-effects meta-analysis.

Evidence-based decision-making is something many see as ideal.
 Current models for evidence-based decision-making have set requirements
 of what qualify as evidence, and may even rate evidence from low to high
 quality.
 Still, evidence is a vaguely defined term.
 I am often puzzled about what is, and what is not, seen as evidence.
 Is evidence restricted to data? Can an expert judgment be evidence? Can
 a prediction from a complex simulation model be evidence? To get a little
 wiser I studied the definition of evidence in examples of Bayesian analysis.
 I find that a Bayesian interpretation of evidence is broader than put forward
 in current evidence-based frameworks.
 Perhaps this broader view can be useful when setting new standards to evaluate
 quality of evidence in evidence-based decision-making.

The non-parametric bootstrap is a popular statistical method that produces
 something that looks very much like draws from a Bayesian posterior distributio
n.
 There are papers comparing the bootstrap to Bayesian models and one might
 wonder which alternative is more appropriate: Bayes or bootstrap? But these
 are not opposing alternatives, because the non-parametric bootstrap is
 a Bayesian model.
 Just because it’s Bayesian does not necessarily mean it is any good and
 “We used a Bayesian model” is as much a quality assurance as “we used probabili
ty to calculate something”.
 However, writing out a statistical method as a Bayesian model can help
 you understand when that method could work well and how it can be made
 better.

Epidemiology is a science that seek to understand the variation in disease
 across population groups.
 The study designs are usually observational, which hampers the possibilities
 to draw firm conclusions regarding cause and effect.
 Subgroups are often investigated in order to identify groups that are especiall
y susceptible to exposure or treatment effects, which means that multiple
 inferences are routinely conducted.
 All this makes epidemiology a suitable arena for both empirical and fully
 Bayesian methods, but such methods are still quite rarely used within the
 field.
 In this talk, I will give examples of Bayesian approaches in epidemiological
 research, and discuss what can be done in order to make Bayesian methods
 more widespread among epidemiologists.

During the latest years supervised topic models has become more and more
 popular as an approach for modeling textual data to predict a label.
 We introduce a supervised topic model to handle both many classes as well
 as many covariates in the stage of prediction.
 To handle many classes we use the recently proposed Diagonal Orthant probit
 model for multiclass classification and to handle many topics and covariates
 we use an efficient horseshoe prior for variable selection/shrinkage.

Predicting tree growth is important in forestry.
 Forest dynamics - including immigration of trees, their growth and death
 due to natural causes or interactions with other trees - can be spatio-temporal
ly modeled by a time-dependent marked point process, where the points correspond
 to locations of trees and the marks to their sizes.
 In this case study, a Growth-Interaction-process containing all building
 blocks mentioned above is used to model the growth of Swedish Scots pines.
 We concentrate on the open growth (without interactions), and compare a
 hierarchical Bayesian and a frequentist mixed approach to estimate the
 parameters of the growth function.
